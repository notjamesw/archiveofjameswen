		<p> Coming in at number one is the greatest Tristana plays the world has ever seen. It was from this day onward that the mere mention of JamesWen's Tristana evokes fear in the hearts of mortals.

		<p> While it is not quite as infamous as the Tristana outplay, this jawdropping Yasuo play has inspired many players to spend their hard earned 6300BE on Yasuo in hopes of recreating the same play themselves one day.

			Allan Hu could not have been more proud of this insane dive, setup and perfectly executed by the GOAT JamesWen. JamesWen's excellent shotcalling, gamesense and mechanical prowess is evidently shown in this dive, uttering "stunning" the enemy so much so that their miniscule crania could not handle the pure intelligence radiating from this outplay.

		<p> JamesWen stands at the forefront of innovation in Valorant. One example of his ingenuity and endless creativity is his August 1st, 2022, round 2 phoenix play in 5-stack unrated. While his team was down one round and in desparate need of a morale boost, JamesWen delivered and came in clutch, shocking the world with his massive brain play. This 200IQ Phoenix flash revolunized the way Phoenix was played and changed the game forever.

		<p> In this clip, JamesWen once again uses his massive cranium to deduce the most intelligent play possible in the heat of the moment as he backward b-hops his own flash to help his team secure a round against his formitable opponents.
